Added a centered `h1` while leaving existing paragraph content intact by using a minimal, scoped style block and absolute positioning to center the heading on load. Change is in `index.html`.

Tests not run (no test or build commands found in the repo).

Changelog:
- Added a centered `<h1>` with “Welcome to the Hackathon” and minimal CSS in `index.html`.
